### Recommendations
In evaluating the top 5 markets for Glo in 2025, we uncovered 4 opportunity marktes to focus on in 2026: 

1. Balitmore, MD
2. Kansas City, MO
3. Minneapolis, MN
4. Detroit, MI

These 4 markets all perform above average in our market rating, and we consistently sell homes above the median in the area. Meanwhlie, we only have 3-4% of market share in these cities, compared to our 6-19% market share in our top markets. 

If Glo's marketing team can concentrate marketing efforts in these 4 markets with the goal of increasing share of market by 50%, we could expect the following impacts to 2026 revenue: 

* **Baltiomre, MD** reveunue could increase from **$1.4M** in 2025 to **$2.0M** in 2026.
* **Kansas City, MO** revenue could increase from **$1.4M** in 2025 to **$2.1M** in 2026.
* **Minneapolis, MN** revenue could increase from **$1.4M** in 2025 to **$2.0M** in 2026.
* **Detroit, MI** revenue could increase from **$1.7M** in 2025 to **$2.6M** in 2026.
* **Total revenue could increase from $5.9M in 2025 to $8.7M in 2026.**
